## Used Technologies ##

Each of our 3 services uses a NodeJs server.
The front-end was made using the Angular framework, the API was made using FeatherJS, a Mariadb database and the Imagery Service used Express to create a REST API.

> # Usage #
> `docker-compose up -d --build`
>
> **âš  WARNING: for unknown reason, our DBMS (Mariadb) doesn't have enough time to create the database on first launch of the docker before the API tries to connect to it.**
>> ### Solution ###
>> `docker-compose up -d --build && docker-compose stop && docker-compose up -d --build`
>
> If left unchanged, the **.dotenv** presents at the root of the repository will expose our services on **port 81** for the Front-End,  **port 3031** for the API, **port 3001** for the Imagery Service and *port 3307* for the DBMS.
